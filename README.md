<h1>Learning Management System</h1>

<h2>About this Project:</h2>
<p></br>
  &emsp;Developed over a few months, this project is a smaller-scale implementation of a learning management system (LMS), akin to popular platforms like Canvas and Blackboard. Developed using C# and the .NET Framework, it serves as a full-stack web application designed to facilitate basic educational management functionalities.</br>
</br>
  &emsp;The aim of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in C# and the .NET Framework while showcasing foundational skills in web development and database management.
  </br>It serves as a practical exercise in building a functional web application tailored for educational purposes, albeit at a smaller scope than enterprise-level LMS platforms.&emsp;
